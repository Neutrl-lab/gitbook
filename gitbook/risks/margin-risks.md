# Margin Risks

Margin risk refers to the potential for the protocol's trading positions to be forcibly liquidated by an exchange's risk management engine due to insufficient collateral to meet margin requirements. This risk is particularly relevant when the protocol uses **perpetual futures contracts** for hedging or arbitrage purposes.

Forced liquidation occurs when the collateral value on an exchange account falls below the **Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR)** set by the exchange. This can happen due to:

* Sudden adverse price movements.
* High leverage usage, amplifying the impact of price volatility.
* Delays in adding collateral to replenish margin requirements.

Liquidations result in realized losses, potentially disrupt the protocol's hedging or arbitrage strategy, and may expose the protocol to further risks if positions cannot be quickly re-established.

#### **Sources of Margin Risk**

1. **Excessive Leverage**:
   * High leverage amplifies the impact of price volatility, increasing the likelihood of margin calls and forced liquidations.
2. **Market Volatility**:
   * Sudden and extreme price movements in assets can rapidly erode collateral value, especially during low-liquidity periods or market crashes.
3. **Collateral Volatility**:
   * If the protocol uses volatile assets as collateral, fluctuations in their value can increase the risk of liquidation.
4. **Exchange-Specific Liquidation Mechanisms**:
   * Different exchanges use varying liquidation thresholds, risk engines, and margin call protocols. These inconsistencies can create additional complexity in managing margin risk.
5. **Delayed Reactions to Margin Calls**:
   * In fast-moving markets, delays in deploying additional collateral to meet margin requirements can result in liquidation.
6. **Liquidity Crises**:
   * In periods of market stress, a lack of liquidity can result in slippage during liquidation events, magnifying realized losses.

#### **Risk Mitigation Measures**

**1. Leverage Limits**

* The protocol employs strict leverage limits for perpetual futures positions to ensure that collateral buffers are sufficient to withstand significant market volatility.
* Positions are typically over-collateralized, with a **margin utilization ratio** well below the maximum allowed on the exchange.

**2. Dynamic Margin Management**

* The protocol actively monitors **margin ratios** across all exchanges in real-time using automated systems.
* When margin levels approach critical thresholds, additional collateral is deployed immediately to prevent liquidation.
* Automated alerts are triggered when margin utilization exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., 50% utilization), enabling the team to act promptly.
* Collateral top-ups are automated in most cases, with manual intervention available for exceptional circumstances.

**3. Diversified Exchange Usage**

* Positions are distributed across multiple exchanges to reduce concentration risk and exposure to a single exchange's liquidation engine.
* Each exchangeâ€™s margin requirements, liquidation thresholds, and risk management systems are thoroughly analyzed to ensure compatibility with the protocol's trading strategy.

**4. Stress Testing for Margin Requirements**

* The protocol conducts regular **stress tests** to simulate extreme market conditions, including:
  * Sudden price crashes or rapid depegging of collateral.
  * High volatility scenarios with cascading liquidations across multiple exchanges.
  * Periods of low liquidity, where slippage is significant during forced liquidations.
* **Key Metrics Tested**:
  * Margin utilization ratios.
  * Impact of price movements on collateral value and maintenance margin.
  * Liquidity available to absorb additional collateral requirements.

**5. Proactive Position Reduction**

* In periods of abnormal market conditions (e.g., extreme volatility or low liquidity), the protocol proactively reduces the size of its trading positions to minimize exposure.
* This includes partially closing funding arbitrage positions or adjusting hedges to reduce margin utilization.

**6. Reserve Fund Support**

* The protocol maintains a **reserve fund** that can be rapidly deployed to bolster margin positions if necessary.
* This reserve is capitalized using a portion of protocol revenues and is held in stablecoins or other equivalently liquid assets.

**7. 24/7 Coverage**

* The protocol operates a **24/7 trading team** with global coverage, ensuring continuous monitoring of margin positions and market conditions.
* The team is supported by automated systems for margin management, with manual intervention available in the event of abnormalities.

**8. Liquidity Management**

* The protocol maintains sufficient liquidity to meet collateral requirements across all exchanges.
* A portion of assets is held in highly liquid stablecoins to ensure immediate availability for margin top-ups.
