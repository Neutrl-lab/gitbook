# What is Neutrl ?&#x20;

## **Neutrl: Scalable, Market-Neutral Synthetic Dollar**

Neutrl is a market-neutral synthetic dollar designed to unlock untapped yield opportunities in OTC and altcoin markets. Neutrl leverages OTC arbitrage, funding rate inefficiencies, and DeFi-native market-neutral strategies to provide a single, high-yield access point for capital allocators.

### **How Neutrl Works**

#### **1. Yield Generation with Market Neutrality**

Neutrl creates a synthetic dollar, **NUSD**, that captures asymmetric yield opportunities while maintaining market neutrality. This is achieved through:

* **OTC Arbitrage**:\
  Neutrl acquires crypto assets at deep discounts through OTC deals, with enforced on-chain settlement via smart contracts or qualified custodians. These are then hedged using perpetual futures, capturing unmatched yield potential for large allocators.
* **Delta-Neutral Hedging**:\
  To stabilize NUSD’s value, Neutrl uses derivatives to hedge market exposure. This ensures that NUSD maintains a stable value relative to its backing assets, regardless of market trends.

#### **2. Basis and Funding Arbitrage**

Neutrl leverages **basis arbitrage** opportunities in perpetual futures markets to generate additional yield:

* **What is Basis Arbitrage?**\
  In perpetual futures markets, the futures price of an asset often deviates from its spot price due to supply and demand imbalances, creating a "basis." Neutrl capitalizes on this spread by simultaneously holding a long position in the spot market and a short position in the futures market.
* **Funding Rate Arbitrage**:\
  Perpetual futures contracts require traders to pay or receive funding fees to maintain price parity with the spot market. Neutrl takes advantage of this by capturing **positive funding rates**, where short positions (held by the protocol) receive periodic payments from traders holding long positions.
* **Market Neutral Strategy**:\
  By combining spot and futures positions, Neutrl eliminates directional risk while generating consistent returns from the **basis spread** and **funding rate payments**. This approach ensures that yield is earned regardless of whether the market moves up or down.

### **Key Features of NUSD**

#### **1. Fully-Backed Synthetic Dollar**

NUSD is fully backed by a diversified portfolio, offering a **higher margin of safety** compared to traditional basis trades. OTC discounts enhance the protocol’s stability and yield potential.

#### **2. Free to Use in CeFi and DeFi**

NUSD integrates seamlessly across both CeFi and DeFi ecosystems, with **high composability** for use cases such as lending, trading, and liquidity provision.

#### **3. Peg Stability Mechanism**

The protocol maintains NUSD’s peg by using **delta hedging derivatives** against its backing assets. This stabilizes NUSD while capturing yield from spot crypto assets and futures markets.

### **Neutrl's Built-in Positive Flywheel Effect**

When fresh NUSD flows in, **sNUSD’s headline yield is fractionally diluted**—the very spark that ignites the flywheel:

1. **Yield compression nudges capital out the risk-curve.**\
   As the liquid APY drifts toward the on-chain risk-free rate, yield-hunters stake their NUSD, convert to sNUSD, or extend their existing locks to 6-, 9- or 12-month terms in search of a richer rate.
2. **Longer locks unlock bigger trade tickets.**\
   The moment more capital sits in those dated buckets, the treasury can scale into deeper OTC carry deals and term-basis trades that were unavailable at smaller size.
3. **Protocol deploys, composite APY lifts.**\
   Higher-capacity, higher-spread trades feed straight back into the yield pool; sNUSD’s auto-reindex ticks up
4. **Rising yield pulls in the next wave of deposits.**\
   A louder headline APR attracts fresh capital, swelling TVL and restarting the cycle.

This positive-feedback loop spins until either (a) the market runs out of attractive longer-tenor deals. Because the flywheel is **programmatic and endogenous**—no discretionary knobs, no human committee—Neutrl can surf boom-and-bust market regimes while keeping redemptions smooth and yields competitive. More deposits raise capacity, capacity raises yield, and higher yield brings the next deposits. \
