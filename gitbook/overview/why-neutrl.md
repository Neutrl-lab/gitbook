# Why Neutrl?

**Neutrl exists to turn a plain-vanilla dollar into the most efficient wealth-preservation asset in crypto.**\
Traditional stable-coins freeze your purchasing power; Neutrl gives it a steady tail-wind by opening the door to yield engines normally reserved for funds, desks and “qualified” wallets.

#### The problem

1. **Institution-grade yield is gated.**\
   The best carry trades, basis spreads and funding-rate harvests clear through OTC desks and prime brokers that demand seven-figure tickets, credit relationships and legal firepower.
2. **Public stable-coins pocket the upside.**\
   USDC, USDT and their clones earn on the backing collateral but pass almost nothing to holders. Your dollar stays flat while the issuer compounds.
3. **DIY strategies are brittle.**\
   Retail yield farms spike, decay and sometimes implode. Chasing them is a full-time job with headline risk, smart-contract risk and other idiosyncractic risks.

#### Our answer

Neutrl packages three institutional playbooks—**liquid basis, on-chain risk-free rate, and institutional arbitrage**—into a single, duration-matched protocol with the yield flowing straight to holders.

| Token     | What you get                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N**USD**  | A spendable, highly capital efficient and composable T+2-redeemable dollar  |
| **sNUSD** | A “turbo-dollar” that auto reindexes with protocol’s net income.            |

#### Why Neutrl is better than legacy stables

* **Yield you can see.** Your balance grows every day; no need to chase pools or wrap your coins.
* **Same liquidity promise.** NUSD redemptions clear in ≤ 48 h—identical to USDC’s wire-out time.
* **Risk controlled on-chain.** Assets and liabilities are locked in a 1-for-1 duration ladder, with minimal weighted-average-maturity gap&#x20;
* **No privileged front-row.** Minimum size is one token; every holder, big or small, accesses the same institutional yields.



By combining crypto-native trading yield with institutional strategies, Neutrl unlocks a new category of decentralised, high-yield opportunities for traders and liquidity providers alike.
