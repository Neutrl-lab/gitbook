# Security

## Risk management

To ensure the security and efficiency of the protocol, Neutrl implements:

* **Custody Solutions** – Off-exchange settlement via Copper Clearloop and Fireblocks mitigates counterparty risk.
* **Exchange Diversification** – Trading activity is distributed across Binance, OKX, and other major platforms to reduce exposure to exchange-specific failures.
* **Redundancy Mechanisms** – Liquidity pools and dynamic liquidity ratios guarantee seamless redemptions.
* **Collateral Optimization** – Systematic hedging minimizes liquidation risk.

**Insurance Pool**

* Funded by protocol fees, this pool provides a buffer against extreme market events.
